# PyGames

This repo is dedicated to three games built using Python and its Libraries, as follows:

1. PyHangmanGame : This is a simple game of Hangman, wherein one has to arrive at a word by means of guessing the correct set of letters, in a limited number of moves.
   On running the code in any of the Python interpreters, we must enter the 'No of players' and 'No of computers', followed by entering one letter at a time and pressing 'Enter'.
